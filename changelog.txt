Version 1.1
** The Asset Update **

New Features:
- Added new finite assets that you can obtain! Including:
  - Gold, silver, and more!
- !mine
  - Think of it like '!work' but for gold!
- !exchange
  - A two-way transfer of any asset you want!
  - Want to request an exchange of $249.99 for 3 oz of Billy's gold?
    - Run `!exchange @billy 249.99 cash 3 gold`

Changes:
- Re-hauled the action system:
  - Now, !work is just one of the types of actions you can do
  - You can only perform one action at a time, so choose wisely!
- !leaderboard can now be sorted by different assets
- !transfer
  - Can now be used for all assets
  - Requests confirmation before finishing transaction
- !deal_with_the_devil/!dwtd is now: !dice

Bug Fixes:
- Burger Bucks are now stored in an integer datatype
  - This means your cash balance as displayed is 100% accurate, eliminating weird off-by-one-cent errors
  - Any weird rounding errors you might have encountered when moving money around are also now eliminated.
