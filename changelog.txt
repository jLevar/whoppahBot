Version 1.1
** The Asset Update **

New Features:
- Added new finite assets that you can obtain! Including:
  - Gold, silver, and more!
- !exchange
  - A two-way transfer of any asset you want!
  - Want to request an exchange of $249.99 for 3 oz of Billy's gold?
    - Run `!exchange @billy 249.99 cash 3 gold`

Changes:
- !leaderboard can now be sorted by different assets
- !transfer
  - Can now be used for all assets
  - Requests confirmation before finishing transaction

Bug Fixes:
- Burger Bucks are now stored in an integer datatype
  - This means your cash balance as displayed is 100% accurate, eliminating weird off-by-one-cent errors
  - Any weird rounding errors you might have encountered are also now eliminated.
